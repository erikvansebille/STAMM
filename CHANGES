# STAMM CHANGES

## STAMM-2.1.0

1- Allow CMEMS data:
An option CenteredGrid was added. If True, at each time step a C-grid is computed based on a linear interpolation of the A-grid.

Overlap is managed properly: no more needed to create one manually.

New mesh managment: providing a mesh is not needed anymore. The mask is automatically created based on the firsts U, V, T and NPP files so that data is available for all forcings where mask = 1 (ocean). This option is only available for Centered Grids (A grids). Also, e1t, e2t, e1v, e2u, glamu and gphiv are calculated automatically if not provided.


2- Improve security:
Avoid coast crashes due to random Von Mises: if the turtle is near land and its total velocity is directed towards land, velocity is set to 0 at the land side. It is also possible to use the bounce option so that turtles bounce against land.

New function to check if all parameters are given.

Habitat is forced to be between 0 and 1 and to be 0 on land.

NPP is forced to be positive.

Check there are sufficient files to compute simulation.


3- Be user friendly:

Option to loop periodically data

Print day of simulation at each time step given a time_origin

nsteps_max is calculated automatically

Namelist was simplified

Print total time of simulation

4- Other improvements:
The main for loop in Ariane was parallelized, but not tested.

The current velocity encountered by turtles is calculated at the end of the simulation in an exact way.

Computation was speed up.
